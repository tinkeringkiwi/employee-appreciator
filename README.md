# Employee Appreciator
Generates a beautiful keepsake token of corporate's appreciation of employees. Perfect for christmas gifts or boosting morale around the office when the budget isn't there for a pizza party. 

## [Use the Appreciator](https://appreciator.myhackathon.app/)

## Running
This was a hackathon project and I'm not sure why anyone would want to run it. If you want to run this somewhere for some reason, the easiest way is to build or use the Docker image available at the repo. 

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You'll also want to run the Python backend by simply running `cd backend/ && python3 main.py` for the image generation.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
